CS50 Final Project - POTE

The project is an iOS application where recipes can be found.
The name Pote comes from the Portuguese that means small cauldron in English.

I wanted to make an iOS project to expand my knowledge on Applications development and like this because I love to cook, and new ideas are not too much.

On this project the language used is Swift. I used API connections, user defaults for some settings and Core data for the Favorites.

How the Application works?

The idea is simple. Install the application and enter on it.
No account needed. Must be connected to internet. 
The user enters on the application and has the main page where on the top is the logo, a cauldron, following by the application’s name.
Further down there are some recipes ideas: 
•    TREND OF THE MOMENT: what is in 
•    VEGI INSPIRATIONS?: some vegetarian recipe ideas
•    A LITTLE SWEETNESS: some dessert recipes, cakes, crumbles, etc.
•    ALL RECIPES: all recipes, no criteria.

On each section you have some recipes with each one an image and name, you can view more by scrolling horizontal.
The last section is vertical scrolling.

If you want to do your search just tap on the magnifying glass to write your query and you have your results.
This query can be one specific recipe, ingredient based, cuisine, meal etc.

To look inside that recipe, you just need to tap inside the one you like. On the main page or on your query results.
Once tapped a new page will appear with the recipe image, minutes to prepare, servings, Ingredients needed following by the Instructions.

You can also add the recipe to your favorites by clicking on the heart button at the top, if it comes red is saved on your favorites. If you don’t want it anymore on your favorites just click again so the heart become gray.
You can check the favorites list by clicking on the blue heart at the bottom.

Whenever on which page you are you can navigate to another page by clicking on the bottom buttons - main page, favorites list and the search query.

That is it. Hope you enjoy and Happy cooking.
